    13:32 < ether> booo done\_testing--  
    13:32 < ether> Y U NO LIKE Test::NoWarnings  
    13:33 < ether> I do have a tuit item to make Test::NoWarnings play nicer with done\_testing.. others have also opened tickets about it  
    13:33 < ether> but for now, I like Test::NoWarnings more than I dislike counting my tests.  
    13:43 <@xdg> I feel like there ought to be a better way than Test::NoWarnings  
    13:43 <@xdg> ether, go check out Test::Roo, btw  
    13:48 <@xdg> ether, really, if Test::NoWarnings didn't force an END block, then you could just import "had\_no\_warnings" and do "had\_no\_warnings; done\_testing" at the end  
    14:03 < ether> Test::NoWarnings should import its own version of done\_testing that does that automatically  
    14:03 < ether> I like the 'set it and forget it' feature of TNW  
    14:03 < ether> actually.. this is totally doable if we can detect in the END block if done\_testing has already been called  
    14:03 < ether> if it hasn't, add an extra test as normal  
    14:04 < ether> if it has, do nothing, because done\_testing already did the check  
    14:05 < ether> hell yeah, this is totally doable  
    14:05  * ether scribbles notes  
    14:08  * ether cries.. finds a note dated March 2011 with this exact same thought.  
    14:08 < ether> ETOOMANYTUITS  
    14:09 < ether> er tuit items, not tuit timeslots  
    14:09 <@xdg> ether, how about this: https://gist.github.com/dagolden/5033795  
    14:09 <+dipsy> [ Test::NoWarnings ]  
    14:09 <@xdg> er, Test::FailWarnings, I mean  
    14:10 <@xdg> it just throws fails() on warnings.  
    14:10 <@xdg> easy  
    14:28 < ether> hmmm  
    14:28 < ether> Test::NoWarnings is quite pervasive, so I see the appeal in fixing it rather than (or as well as?) creating something new  
    14:32 < ether> TNW is pretty crufty though  
    14:32 < ether> I'll ponder more tonight. paid work is beckoning again.  
    14:45 <@xdg> ether, I just shipped it.  Feel free to use/enhance.  :-)

    14:54 < ether> lol  
    14:54 <@xdg> dzil just makes it way too easy  

And that was that!  But wait...

I'm somewhat fond of test counts (occasionally I comment out some tests to
avoid them getting in the way of debugging something else, for example), so I
like having that extra check that I haven't omitted something I shouldn't. But
I'd still like to be able to use the same no-warnings tester as if I were
using done_testing, so I can switch back and forth between having a plan, or
not, without having to change other things.

My round tuit supply has been short of late, so I've had to chew on this
idea in small morsels. Today however I made a bit of time, so I was able to
bash out an implementation of my idea -- [Test::Warnings](http://metacpan.org/module/Test::Warnings).

It's released as TRIAL for now, to demonstrate it's still experimental (as per [CPAN is for experimentation and I hope that never changes](http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/1946/cpan-is-for-experimentation-and-i-hope-that-never-changes/) (hey, look it's Dave again.. do I see a pattern here.. ;) ), but I do hope this proves to be useful, and I definitely don't intend to
abandon the module as long as it is.

I've also learned some new interesting things about the toolchain and how Test::Builder works... if you look at the commit
history on [github](https://github.com/karenetheridge/Test-Warnings)
you'll see I had to make a few hacks to allow everything to work *and* let me
test everything with Test::Tester (and even then, I couldn't test
`done_testing` explicitly with Test::Tester, as once `done_testing` is
called, there can be no more tests, at any level!).

I'm also planning on adding more features soon, tuits-dependent of course. :)

And with that, this ends my first blog post, and third self-authored CPAN
distribution. It's been a good day.
